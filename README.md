# Patty - 3D Game Engine
Patty is a 3D game engine based on SDL and OpenGL developed for the final project of George Mason Universities CS425 Game Programming course. Over the course of 2 weeks the engine went from being able to display a black screen, to loading in custom .obj files with custom .bmp textures and placed within a scene. Using SDL2, music and inputs were handeled, causing the bulk of the work on this engine to be the specific integration of OpenGL with SDL.
